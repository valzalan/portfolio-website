My Portfolio Website

The Goal

The goal of this project was to make a simple, yet elegant website to host my web development projects.
When deciding on features I wanted to find a good balance between simplicity and complexity. As it was important to
showcase my knowledge, but at the same time it had to be feasible as well.

Tech stack

For the build process I used Gulp. I bundled my Javascript files with browserify. For polyfills, I used Babel,
minified with Uglify. I also linted with ESLint, using the idiomatic style. As for the stylesheets, I prefixed with
autoprefixer.
The 'live-server' npm package was used during development.
When debugging I mostly turned to Chrome dev tools.

I'm using Heroku for hosting.
